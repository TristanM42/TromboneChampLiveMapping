# TromboneChampLiveMapping

Go to release and download the zip (don't mind the name "Source code", it's actually only the dist folder).
Then launch go to dist\tromboneLiveMapping and run tromboneLiveMapping.exe.

There is a prompt but no instructions, so here are the instructions :
  - go to Trombone Champ and start the song you want
  - the record start at the first note you press
  - press w or x for recording a note
  - you can hold them longer and move mouse to create sliders
  - press escape to finish the record
  - in the same folder of the .exe, you will find a song.tmb that you recorded
  - you can edit it for song name, etc, but don't touch the tempo or the endpoint !
